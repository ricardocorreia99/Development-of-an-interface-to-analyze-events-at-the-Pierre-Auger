# Development-of-an-interface-to-analyze-events-at-the-Pierre-Auger

 The Pierre Auger Observatory has made 10% of cosmic ray data available to the public. Using this data, the Unity3D development platform and the Pierre Auger event viewer made in previous LIP Internships, it was possible to create an interface aimed at Masterclasses, intended to be used by students. With a dynamic and educational character, it is expected that these students acquire an understanding about cosmic rays and their reconstruction.
